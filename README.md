# shopify-search
Searches for product on shopify and notifies user through discord

Using Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the shopify website, and discord_webhook to setup discord notifications

Before running please make sure that you have:

  - A working discord webhook setup
  
  - Installed requests, beautifulsoup, lxml, and discord_webhook: pip install -U requests bs4 lxml discord_webhook
  
Working on next:
  
  - Adding discord chat bot that gets commands from user through discord and notifies user through chat
  
  - Adding a gui to make everything cleaner (this will take a lot of self-learning)
